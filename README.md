## Random Rademacher Taylor series

Phase portrait of a random polynomial of degree 2021 with +/-1 random coefficients. By Ryll-Nardzewski's theorem, the limiting random analytic function has a natural border at the border of the disk of radius 1, its domain of convergence, see JP Kahane's book *Some random series of functions*, chapter 4.

## Gaussian Entire Function

Phase portrait of a Gaussian Entire Function (actually it's the Taylor polynomial truncated at degree 200) in the window [-8, 8]x[-8, 8]. The zero set is stationary, see the *GAF Book* by Hough, Krishnapur, Peres, Virag.
