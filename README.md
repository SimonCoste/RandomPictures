## Random Rademacher Taylor series

Phase portrait of a random polynomial of degree 2001 with +/-1 random coefficients. By Ryll-Nardzewski's theorem, the limiting random analytic function has a natural border at the border of the disk of radius 1, its domain of convergence, see JP Kahane's book *Some random series of functions*, chapter 4.
